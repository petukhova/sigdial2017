<h1>CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSION</h1>
<p><font face="Arial">
Special Session Submission Deadline: March 1, 2017</p>

<p><font face="Arial">
Special Session Notification: March 10, 2017 </p>

<p><font face="Arial">
The SIGDIAL organizers welcome the submission of special session proposals. A SIGDIAL special session is the length of a regular session at the conference; may be organized as a poster session, a panel session, or an oral presentation session; and will be held on the last day of the conference. Special sessions may, at the discretion of the SIGDIAL organizers, be held as parallel sessions. </p>

<p><font face="Arial">
The papers submitted to special sessions are handled by special session organizers, but for the submitted papers to be in the SIGDIAL proceedings, they have to undergo the same review process as regular papers. The reviewers for the special session papers will be taken from the SIGDIAL program committee itself but taking into account the suggestions of the session organizers. </p>

<p><font face="Arial">We welcome special session proposals on any topic of interest to the discourse and dialogue communities.</p>

<p>Submissions:</p>

<p>Those wishing to organize a special session should prepare a two-page proposal containing: </p>

<ul>
    <li> a summary of the topic of the special session;<br>
	<li> a list of organizers and sponsors; <br>
	<li> a list of people who may submit and participate in the session; and <br>
	<li> a requested format (poster/panel/oral session). <br>
</ul>

<p>
These proposals should be sent to conference[at]sigdial.org by the special session proposal deadline. Special session proposals will be reviewed jointly by the general and program co-chairs.</p>
