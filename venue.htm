<h2>Travel</h2>

<h3>Air</h3>

<p>The most two convenient airports for the conference venue are
  <a href="https://www.frankfurt-airport.com/en/flights---more/flights.html" target="_blank">Frankfurt International
    Airport (FRA)</a> and <a href="http://www.parisaeroport.fr/en" target="_blank">Paris International
    Airport (CDG)</a>, both offering non-stop connections throughout Europe  as well as to North and South America, Asia and Oceania.
  Transportation options between the airports and USAAR are TBA.
</p>

<!--
<ul>
  <li>A taxi ride typically costs $25&ndash;30 and takes about
    10&nbsp;minutes.
  <li>A shared van ride costs $18&ndash;20 per person (+tip); 
    reservations are not necessary, but can be made with
    <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com" target="_blank">Supershuttle</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.primetimeshuttle.com" target="_blank">Prime Time
      Shuttle</a>.
  <li>Public bus service is available but inconvenient:
    take the free shuttle bus&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rdquo;
    from the terminal to the LAX Metro Bus Center, then catch
    <a href="http://www.culvercity.org/enjoy/culver-city-bus/maps-schedules/line-6-sepulveda-blvd" target="_blank">Culver
      City Bus Route&nbsp;6 or Rapid&nbsp;6</a> to the corner of
      Centinela and Sepulveda, which is a 1200m walk from ICT.  The
      fare is&nbsp;$1 (exact change) and the ride (including
      transfers) typically takes 30&ndash;60 minutes. (If your flight
      arrives at Terminal&nbsp;1 or&nbsp;2 and it&rsquo;s a nice day
      you may prefer to skip the shuttle bus and just walk to the LAX
      Metro Bus Center, it&rsquo;s 1200m by foot from
      Terminal&nbsp;1.)
</ul>
-->
<p>Saarbrücken has its own <a href="http://www.flughafen-saarbruecken.de/index.php?id=1&L=1" target="_blank">Saarbrücken Airport</a> with flights mostly operated by <a href="http://www.airberlin.com" target="_blank">AirBerlin</a> offering connections throughout Europe and to North America. For instance, flights from Berlin or Hamburg to Saarbrücken take between 1 hour 10 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes. Saarbrücken Airport is situated about 12 km from the university campus. The bus from the airport to the university takes between 45 minutes and one hour and costs €2.50. A taxi will take you to the university in 15-20 minutes and costs around €20.

</p>
<p>Alternatively, inexpensive flights are available to Luxembourg, Frankfurt Hahn and Düsseldorf <br>
  <a href="http://www.lux-airport.lu/en/Home.1.html" target="_blank">Luxembourg Airport (LUX)</a> 111 km;<br>
  <a href="https://www.hahn-airport.de/" target="_blank">Frankfurt Hahn Airport (HHN)</a>  115 km;<br>
  <a href="https://www.dus.com/en" target="_blank">Düsseldorf Airport (DUS)</a>  300 km but has convenient connecting train connections.
</p>

<h3>Rail</h3>

<p>Saarbrücken is very conveniently reached by rail.  <a href="http://www.bahn.de" target="_blank">Deutsche Bahn</a> has a series of
  direct and connecting train services throughout Germany and Europe. High-speed ICE/TGV services are available from Frankfurt/Mannheim and Paris to Saarbrücken central station. 
  Regional services run from Mainz, Trier and Strasbourg.
  
</p>

<h3>Car</h3>

<p> Saarbrücken has an extensive network of roads and freeways, making
  it easy to get anywhere by car (if you don&rsquo;t mind the
  traffic).  However, participants probably won&rsquo;t need a car for the
  duration of the conference, bus tickets will be included in the registration fee.
</p>

<p><strong>Parking</strong> 
Visitors can park for a fee of €1/hour (max. charge: €3; the first 60 min. are free of charge) 
in the campus car parks P2 ('Uni Mitte') and P3 ('Uni Ost'), see  <a href="http://www.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Footer/Parken/parkzonen.pdf" target="_blank">Parking at campus map</a>. However, the parking situation at campus is rather complicated and places are limited.
</p>

<h3>Bus</h3>

<p>Saarbrücken Campus is served by the following <a href="http://www.uni-saarland.de/en/footer/dialogue/find-us/saarbruecken/train/bus-lines.html" target="_blank">bus routes</a>. There are several bus stops on campus: <br>
